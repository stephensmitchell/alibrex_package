AI summary: The script exports all 2D sketches named 'Sketch<1>', 'Sketch<2>', etc., from the current part to SVG files, handling unsaved parts and errors if sketches are not found, with a limit of 50 sketches.

```python
def export_all_sketches_guessing_names():
    """
    Attempts to export every 2D sketch named 'Sketch<1>', 'Sketch<2>', etc.,
    up to some range, from the currently open part. 
    This includes sketches not used by features, 
    but also can produce errors if the name doesn't exist.
