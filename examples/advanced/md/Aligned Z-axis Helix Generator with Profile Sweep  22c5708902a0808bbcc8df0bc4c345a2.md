```python
# Aligned Z-axis helix with profile starting at same point and normal
import math
P = Part("Helix_ZAxisAligned")

# PARAMETERS
radius = 65
pitch = 300
turns = 3
step = 10
profile_radius = 2

# BUILD HELIX AROUND Z-AXIS (centered)
points = []
for a in range(0, 360 * turns + 1, step):
    rad = math.radians(a)
    x = radius * math.cos(rad)
    y = radius * math.sin(rad)
    z = pitch * a / 360.0
    points.extend([x, y, z])

print("Helix path starts at:", [points[0], points[1], points[2]])

# CREATE PATH
Path = P.Add3DSketch("HelixPath")
Path.AddBspline(points)

# CREATE PROFILE PLANE at path start: normal to Z, origin at [0, 0, 0]
Pln = P.AddPlane("ProfilePlane", [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0])
Sketch = P.AddSketch("Profile", Pln)

# PROFILE CENTERED AT PATH START (drawn at [radius, 0] on Z-normal plane at origin)
Sketch.AddCircle(radius, 0, profile_radius, False)
print("Profile circle drawn at (%.2f, %.2f) on sketch plane at origin" % (radius, 0))

# SWEEP
P.AddSweepBoss("ZHelixSweep", Sketch, Path, False, Part.EndCondition.EntirePath, None, 0, 0, False)
print("Sweep complete.")
