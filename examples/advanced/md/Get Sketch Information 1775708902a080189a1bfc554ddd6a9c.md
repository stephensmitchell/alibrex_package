AI summary: Python script to find and list 3D sketches in a part using a specified naming pattern, handling exceptions for non-existent sketches and printing details about found sketches and their figures.

```python
def find_3d_sketches(part, sketch_format="3DSketch<{}>", max_sketches=50):
    found = []
    for i in range(1, max_sketches+1):
        sketch_name = sketch_format.format(i)
        try:
            sk3d = part.Get3DSketch(sketch_name)
            if sk3d is not None:
                found.append(sk3d)
        except:
            pass
    return found

def main():
    part = CurrentPart()
    if not part:
        print("No active part found. Open a part first.")
        return

    # Change this string if your 3D sketches use a different pattern:
    # e.g. "3D Sketch<{}>", "3D-Sketch<{}>", or "3D Skizze<{}>"
    three_d_sketch_pattern = "3D Sketch<{}>"

    sketches_3d = find_3d_sketches(part, sketch_format=three_d_sketch_pattern, max_sketches=50)
    if not sketches_3d:
        print("No 3D sketches found matching '%s'." % three_d_sketch_pattern)
        return

    for sk in sketches_3d:
        print("----------------------------------------")
        print("  Found 3D Sketch:", sk.Name)
        figures = sk.Figures
        print("  Number of figures:", len(figures))
        for idx, fig in enumerate(figures):
            print("    Figure {}: {}".format(idx+1, type(fig)))

    print("Done!")
